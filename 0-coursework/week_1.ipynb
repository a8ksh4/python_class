    "## About Python\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language - you don'v have to compile your code before running it.  It's disigned to be readable and maintainable, and to do a lot of tasks efficiently.   It's one of the most popular languages for good reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not run as fast as a compiled language like c, c++, fortran, but it has a lot of libraries that are written in c and make specific tasks very fast.  We'll work with pandas later in this class.  Pandas is build around numpy, a very performant library for manipulating lots of numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What can we do with Python?\n",
    "* Machine learning - Look into \"SciPy\" and many other libraries that make ML simple-ish to use.\n",
    "* Analytics and data processing - find trends, do analysis, make graphs!\n",
    "* Automate the boring stuff - office tasks like mail merges, filling out document templates over and over, processing spreadsheet and data\n",
    "* Web scraping - Look into BeautifulSoup or many other libraries\n",
    "* Embeded systems and Robotics - look at micropython and circuitpython, which run on many small microconrtollers\n",
    "* Games - Look into PyGame, Pygame Zero, Turtle, or even Godot engine, which uses a python-like language and can build very advanced games. \n",
    "* Systems automation - read config files, run commands on computers, collect data, do stuff.  \n",
    "* And more!\n",
    "\n",

    "### Libraries\n",
    "You'll learn pretty quickly that learing python is as much about understanding how the language works as getting familiar with libraries to do the things you want to do. A few examples:\n",
    "* import math\n",
    "  * it has functions for rounding, trig, and a lot more\n",
    "* from datetime import datetime\n",
    "  * datetime has tools for manipulating datetime objects!  This is one that's weirdly complex in practice.\n",
    "* import pandas as pd\n",
    "  * Using a short name is a common convention for some library.  pandas is pd, numpy is np, ...\n",
    "  * Pandas is a bit like excel, except you do it all with commands in a reproducible way, rather than one off editing a file manually in excel.\n",

    "## Syntax\n",
    "Reference this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keywords\n",
    "Some words cannot be used as variables because they have special meaning in the python language:  \n",
    "\n",
    "*and as assert async await break case class continue def del elif else except False finally for from global if import in is lambda match None nonlocal not or pass raise return True try while with yield _.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "Python uses indentation to group code inside of functions, classes, and control blocks. Other languages often use { } for the same purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this function called foo has an if else block inside of it, with indentation showing what code belongs to the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def foo(x):\n",
    "        if x == 0:\n",
    "            bar()\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            baz(x)\n",
    "            foo(x - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What would happen if the last line, 'foo(x-1)' were un-indented to the same level as the if and else lines?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What would happen if there were tab characters mixed with the spaces in the indention in the above foo function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An equivelant function in c could be written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    void foo(int x)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if (x == 0) {\n",
    "            bar();\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            baz(x);\n",
    "            foo(x - 1);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "The indentation in c code is functionally unnecessary, but makes it readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quoting\n",
    "Strings, non-numeric values, are quoted with ', \", ''', \"\"\".  We'll look at this more in the strings section below.  Just note this.  Variable names are not quoted, but values when assigned or passed as arguments to a function are if they are to be treated as strings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "* x = \"Hasn't seen it\"\n",
    "* y = '''He said, \"it isn't there.\"'''\n",
    "* ...\n",
