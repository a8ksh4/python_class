## Week 1: Introduction to programming concepts
### W1 Day 1 Lecture - Intro 
* Getting notebook working
* Introduction to programming and Python
** Syntax and symbols
** Grouping/Context - Indentation
** Names of things - Reserved, Capitals, Camelcaser
** Style Guide - https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html
** Structure of a python file vs structure of a notebook
* Interpreter vs notebook vs file/script
* Basic data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
* Variables and basic operators (assignment, arithmetic, comparison)
* Basic input and output (print, input)

#### W1 Day 1 Assignment
1. Create a new notebook that prompts for a name, age, and favorite color, and prints out a greeting. 
2. Add a couple cells to the notebook and define variables with string and numeric types.
3. Print the variables, add them, perform other math operations. 
4. Use dir(your_var_name) to see what built-ins are available for each data type.

### W1 Day 2 Lecture - If/else and more data types
* If/else - a control structure!
** Truthiness
* Lists
** Adding, removing, slicing, 
* Strings
** 'f' strings
** Slicing
** math operations
** Other operations - upper, lower
* Dictionaries

#### W1 Day 2 Homework

## Week 2: Control structures and functions
### W2 Day 1 Lecture - Loops
* Control structures (if/else statements, for loops) and Truthy-ness
* Functions (defining and calling functions, parameters and arguments)
* More on functions (default arguments, keyword arguments, return values)
* Introduction to debugging (print statements, using the debugger)

## Week 3: Working with data
Day 1: Lists and tuples (indexing, slicing, modifying)
Day 2: Dictionaries (defining, accessing values, iterating)
