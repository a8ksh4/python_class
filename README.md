# Python Workshop

Welcome to the Library Python Workshop!

We meet once a week to learn how to program in the Python progamming language.  This is intended to be a work at your own pace environment, just bring any questions and stuff you'd like to look at each week and we all benefit as a group looking at it. 

We have coursework ready to learn a few things:
* Basics
* Data analysis with "Pandas"
* ... Will add more to this list...

## Getting Started
You need a place to run python code and open "ipython notebooks".

Our recommended mode of work will be in notebooks on google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
* Sign up for a google account if you don't have one.
* Log in to https://colab.research.google.com and skim over the readme info
* Open the week one notebook that we'll be working from:
  * Go to File -> Open Notebook -> Github, and paste in "a8ksh4/Python_Class".
  * Open the Library Week 1 notebook file
*   There's a nice intro video for collabe here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI
 
If you're working from your own laptop and want to open notebooks locally rather than in colab, I'd recommend insalling the the Anaconda Python distribution from here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
  * In windows, I'd recommend NOT running the installer as administrator - Install for only a single user when prompted.  It's easier to install packages if it is installed in your home directory rather than a shared area for all users.
  * Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux!
  * You can use any python distribution, but Anaconda is highly recommended becuase its package manager works so well and it has support for so many libraries out-of-the-box.

## Curriculum
These notebooks will be renamed to remove the week # convention.  
* Week 1: Introduction to Python and Google Colab. Covering variables and data types (numeric, strings, boolean), truthiness, and basic control flow (if-else statements).
* Week 2: Exploring more complex data types (lists, tuples, dictionaries) and advanced control flow (loops: for and while).
* Week 3: Introducing functions and modules in Python. Basic introduction to pandas for data analysis, focusing on importing data and initial data exploration.
* Week 4: Building on pandas skills with more advanced data manipulation and introduction to data visualization using pandas and matplotlib for generating graphs.

### Next Steps
* Online Courses
* Weekend projects
* Automate something at work

### Notes on AI like ChatGPT
These tools are very helpful for learning.  For this course, use them to explain how things work, but don't ask them to write code for you.  If you don't experiment and learn for yourself, you won't retain much.  


### Optional Pre-Work
* Create a ChatGPT account and try asking it a few questions - it can be very helpful for figuring out how to do things, why things work the way they do, etc:
  * https://chat.openai.com/chat
  * Example questions:
    * How do I use for loops in python?
    * How do I configure VS Code to use my Anaconda python interpreter?
    * etc!  
* Make a github.com account and install git. 
  * Linux:  sudo apt-get install git
  * Windows:  https://git-scm.com/download/win
  * Check out this repository in your project area: git clone https://github.com/a8ksh4/python_class.git`
  * Feel free to open "bug reports" in this repo for content you'd like to see added, changes needed, or corrections.

* Install a text editor with code highlighting or an IDE for writing code in:
    * Notepad ++: http://notepad-plus-plus.org/
    * VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

* Print out this python cheat sheet: tbd
