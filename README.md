## Background Info
20221222 - This course is being updated with a few things in mind:
* Incorporating Python 3.x changes (print, f-strings, encoding, etc.)
* Prioritizing Notebook Use and adding a variety of data science examples.
* Adding how-tos for some online enveronments to make this as accessible as possible - e.g. https://replit.com/ and https://colab.research.google.com/.
* Adding micropython info and a few notes on microcontroller use.
* Pygamezero?

This guide was originally assembled with scripting and system-automation in mind, but the whole Jupyter Notebook mode of work, I think, makes python more approachable for data manipulation, automating office tasks, etc. And working with python might feel a little more consistent cross-platform when you're working in notebooks, so it's a good format for learning.
  
## Student Pre-Work:
You need somewhere to run your python code, please make sure to have one of these ready to go when class starts:
* If you have your own laptop, please install the Anaconda Python distribution from here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
  * In windows, I'd recommend NOT running the installer as administrator - Install for only a sinble user when prompted.  It's easier to install packages if it is installed in your home directory rather than a shared area for all users.
  * Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux!
  * You can use any python distribution, but Anaconda is highly recommended becuase its package manager works so well and it has support for so many libraries out-of-the-box.
* If you don't have a personal computer to use, or you just prefer web environments, sign into https://colab.research.google.com/ and make sure you can create a notebook there.  You'll need to create a google account if you don't have one.  There's a nice intro video for collabe here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI

* Create a ChatGPT account and try asking it a few questions - it can be very helpful for figuring out how to do things, why things work the way they do, etc:
  * https://chat.openai.com/chat
  * Example questions:
    * How do I use for loops in python?
    * How do I configure VS Code to use my Anaconda python interpreter?
    * etc!  

### Optional Pre-Work
* Make a github.com account and install git. 
  * Linux:  sudo apt-get install git
  * Windows:  https://git-scm.com/download/win
  * Check out this repository in your project area: git clone https://github.com/a8ksh4/python_class.git`
* Feel free to open "bug reports" in this repo for content you'd like to see added, changes needed, or corrections.

* nstall a text editor with code highlighting or an IDE for writing code in:
    * Notepad ++: http://notepad-plus-plus.org/
    * VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

* Print out this python cheat sheet: http://www.astro.up.pt/~sousasag/Python_For_Astronomers/Python_qr.pdf
